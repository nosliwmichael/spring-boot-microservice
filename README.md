# Aperture

This project follows a microservice design pattern using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud dependencies. The goal here is to make each service independent, loosely coupled, highly maintainable, and easily tested. Using Spring Boot, each microservice can be run as a standalone app which already helps meet 3 of the previously mentioned goals. Spring Cloud introduces ways to provide load balancing, service discovery, and inter-service communication in a way that provides minimal code. The downside is the large amount of configuration required to make things work but as you'll see, the pros far outweigh the cons.
